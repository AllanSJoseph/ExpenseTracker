#### MPAndroid Charting Library

MP Android Chart is a library which contains a set of predefined animated charts. This project uses some of the predefined charts for faster development.

#### Multithreading

Using Android's Executor Service, background data calculation, analysis and some crud operations are separated from the main thread for improving performance. This prevents freezing of the app while the new data is updated to the UI asynchronously. Multithreading is used to increase response time for Dashboard and Reports section. But as of now It is not tested with larger data.

#### XML Layout

Android's built in XML layout is used for UI part of the app. Various elements like ImageView, CardView, GridView, etc are utilised.
